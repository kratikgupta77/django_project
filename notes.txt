message model :
1. message is sent through rsa encryption -public key is stored in db while private key stored at client side.
2. message must be first sent TO A web socket and there it waits for the recv to be online.
3. message is displayed without reload.

(Nginx does NOT directly affect encryption but can help ensure WebSockets always route messages correctly to avoid dropped or lost data.
Nginx as a WebSocket reverse proxy ensures stable & persistent WebSocket connections.
If real-time updates are required without page refresh, WebSockets + Nginx is better.
)
problems :

This error happens because the decryption key used does not match the key that was used to encrypt the message.
The encryption key changed after storing messages in the database.
