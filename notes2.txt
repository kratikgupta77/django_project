problems in messaging

Yes, using a self-signed certificate can cause issues when implementing a messaging service between two users, especially if it involves secure WebSockets (wss://), APIs, or authentication. Here’s why:

Potential Problems with a Self-Signed Certificate
Browser Warnings & Blocked Requests

Most browsers will show a security warning and may block WebSocket connections, API requests, or fetch calls made over https:// or wss://.
This can prevent real-time messaging if your frontend relies on WebSockets.
WebSocket Issues (wss://)

WebSockets require secure connections (wss://) when using HTTPS.
Browsers and some clients might reject WebSocket connections if the SSL certificate is not trusted.
You may need to disable SSL verification in your WebSocket client, which is not recommended for production.
CORS & API Issues

If your messaging service makes API calls over https:// (e.g., Django REST Framework), the browser might block them due to CORS policy violations or insecure connection errors.
Mobile App Issues

If you plan to have a mobile app (Android/iOS), most devices won’t accept self-signed certificates by default.
You’d need to manually trust the certificate, which is inconvenient for users.
